I have got this new multimeter for around 15$ and its almost perfect. In
comparing to ANENG multimeters that are often more expensive this one is doing
even more than them.

It has nice big display, very quick response, it can detect voltage without
contact and has flashlight. One thing that I like and was big plus while
searching which one to order was that this multimeter is using 3 x AAA battery
instead of 9V battery.

At the same time when I ordered multimeter I ordered also new probes from
Clequee brand and they are much thicker than original and more flexible, but
they are not silicone. These probes are modular and can replace tips, in package
you get 4 pieces of sharp and 4 of normal needles.

Also big part in choosing this multimeter was that it has 2 replacable fuses
that are normal size and not tiny ones like in ANENG multimeters.
