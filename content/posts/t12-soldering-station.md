After long wait for all parts and some unsuccessful drilling of alu cases from China I have finished T12 controller.
Station works from 12V - 24V and has light indication which indicates how high is temperature by speed of blinking.
It starts with red color on lowest and as it heats up it changes to green color when it reaches selected temperature.

Station is made of DC input socket, 10K potentiometer, GX12 socket for connecting iron, on/off switch, aluminium case and 616dev controller.

You can find all these parts on AliExpress or Ebay just by searching by those names.

Station works as it is intended and I am happy with it. It is a cheap way to build good soldering station by yourself.
Soldering iron handle is 4pin type so it is compatible with Quicko-942 soldering station if I ever want to get one.
