After I got wire stripping tool I felt need to get crimp tool so I can make my
own connections. Crimp tool was around $12 and it is doing what its supposed to
do. It can crimp in ranges 0.1 - 0.5mm, 0.5 - 1.5mm, 1.5 - 2.5mm and 4 - 6mm.
Crimping 2.2mm spade connector and dupont female connector were successful after
few tries.

Long time ago I bought some button switches that uses spade connectors to
connect wires to it and those will be used for diy T12 soldering station
project.

Next post will probably be when I finish T12 soldering station and I will
document building process with pictures and guide.
