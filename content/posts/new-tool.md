I wanted and needed this tool for a long time. It is one of the most important tool for professionals and hobbyist and it is not that expensive, it costs around $10.
This tool comes in many variations and versions but I think this one is best because it have blunt jaws and it doesn't cut wire strands, it just rips wire insulation.

It is called automatic wire stripper and can be bought on Ebay or Aliexpress or in local stores. Many companies rebrand them and sell them under their name but they are all the same quality.

We can all agree this is a must have tool for anyone who is stripping wires either professionally or as hobbyist.

Next tool I am aiming to buy is crimp tool, another essential tool if you are working with wires and connectors.
