This tool is one of the most used in every workshop, got it from ebay for around
10$ and after calibration it is pretty accurate. There are versions that use
single 18650 battery but those were more expensive that this. Why I got this
tester is that ih has connector for leads so I dont need always to use provided
socket. That will hopefully make it last longer.

I have used it very much but it has secret menu with many additional options
like signal generator and so on. This tester can easily be programmed with newer
versions of software as it has exposed holes for 6 pin connector, just as any
mega328p controller based board.
