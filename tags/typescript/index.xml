Is it based on microservices structure with services running on NodeJS with MySQL database, communicating between via RabbitMQ as orchestrator. Only log service should be different by using InfluxDB to store data received via MQTT broker : client flow.
I want to completely write it in Typescript and to try to develop services inside containers using VSCode remote plugins and it was very nice experience so far.</description></item></channel></rss>
