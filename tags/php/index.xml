That&amp;rsquo;s why I have tried to simplify that process.
I have found script called Unzipper that I am going to use for this project - you can download it here.
Plan is to zip or rar (if your hosting allows that) your website and use unzipper script to extract it. Its all plain and simple, it was only needed to modify few lines in unzipper code.</description></item><item><title>Php Based Rest Api</title><link>https://mydiy.space/posts/php-based-rest-api/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2019 20:34:09 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://mydiy.space/posts/php-based-rest-api/</guid><description>For almost every communication esp is doing to the web api is needed, so I tought why don&amp;rsquo;t I build one. I familiarized myself with with what are crucial options api needs to do to be called rest and I think this one does all of that.
I have found a lot info online how to start, how to handle main methods as post, get, put, delete and how every method controls their functions.</description></item><item><title>Email Notifications With Esp Board</title><link>https://mydiy.space/posts/email-notifications-with-esp-board/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2019 20:32:40 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://mydiy.space/posts/email-notifications-with-esp-board/</guid><description>I wanted to create simple notification script that will notify me when my board detects new software version on github by email.
I have tried few smtp micropython libraries and they throw me errors all the time so I opted for simpler solution to create my php script that will send received data as notification to my email.
&amp;lt;?php $_POST = json_decode(file_get_contents(&amp;#39;php://input&amp;#39;), true); $link = $_POST[&amp;#39;link&amp;#39;]; $name = $_POST[&amp;#39;name&amp;#39;]; $version = $_POST[&amp;#39;version&amp;#39;]; $to = &amp;#39;put target email here&amp;#39;; $subject = &amp;#34;New version of $nameis available for download.</description></item><item><title>Post Data to Website Using Esp Board</title><link>https://mydiy.space/posts/post-data-to-website-using-esp-board/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2019 20:29:44 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://mydiy.space/posts/post-data-to-website-using-esp-board/</guid><description>Having many of these boards and wanted to learn micropython, I have decided to make little project and to use esp8266 board to send some data to my website from where I can access it any time or place I want. They are very cheap and can be bought for around $2 on Aliexpress.
Biggest problem I have encountered was when whatever I send to server php did&amp;rsquo;t show anything. I tought it is problem in my python code so I have changed it few times, tried to use post and get dump websites to see how my post request looks and all looked fine.</description></item></channel></rss>
