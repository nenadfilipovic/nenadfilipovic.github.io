I am more into passive ones because they are simpler, use less components, they dont need power supply, they can be connected directly to amplifier output or speaker connectors and they dont affect signal at all.</p><p>Here is one simple schematic found <a href=http://www.giangrandi.ch/electronics/vu-meter/vu-meter.shtml>here</a>.</p><p>Keep in mind this is only one channel so we need all these parts times two. It is only 18 parts for two channels.
This will be a future project and I will update it when its done.</p><p>The circuit is intended to fit an amplifier capable of 80 WRMS driving a 8Î© load, but can easily be adapted to other power levels or impedances.
You can read how this circuit works and how can you adjust it on website I linked above.</p></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>Version:&nbsp;<a href=/log>2.21</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;Built with&nbsp;<a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></nav></div><script>feather.replace()</script></body></html>
