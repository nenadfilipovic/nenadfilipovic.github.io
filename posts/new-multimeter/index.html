Clequee brand and they are much thicker than original and more flexible, but
they are not silicone. These probes are modular and can replace tips, in package
you get 4 pieces of sharp and 4 of normal needles.</p><div class="gallery spotlight-group"><div class=box><div class=frame><div class=image style=background-image:url(/images/new-multimeter/image-1.jpg)></div><a class=spotlight href=/images/new-multimeter/image-1.jpg></a></div></div><div class=box><div class=frame><div class=image style=background-image:url(/images/new-multimeter/image-2.jpg)></div><a class=spotlight href=/images/new-multimeter/image-2.jpg></a></div></div><div class=box><div class=frame><div class=image style=background-image:url(/images/new-multimeter/image-3.jpg)></div><a class=spotlight href=/images/new-multimeter/image-3.jpg></a></div></div><div class=box><div class=frame><div class=image style=background-image:url(/images/new-multimeter/image-4.jpg)></div><a class=spotlight href=/images/new-multimeter/image-4.jpg></a></div></div></div><p>Also big part in choosing this multimeter was that it has 2 replacable fuses
that are normal size and not tiny ones like in ANENG multimeters.</p></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>Version:&nbsp;<a href=/log>2.22</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;Built with&nbsp;<a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></nav></div><script>feather.replace()</script></body></html>
